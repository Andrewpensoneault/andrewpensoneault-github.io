I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Mathematical and Computational Sciences (AMCS) at The University of Iowa who will be graduating in May 2023. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and data assimilation. With a strong foundation in mathematical and computational methods, I am dedicated to developing novel techniques for analyzing and interpreting complex data sets. I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to advance scientific discovery and solve real-world problems.
